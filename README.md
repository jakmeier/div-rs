# Panes

This crate aims to provide a Rust API to easily place HTML elements by pixel coordinates.
It works with absolute positions and can therefore be used to place HTML text elements over a canvas element.

## Examples

TODO

## Implementation policy for Panes
* Compatibility with stable Rust
* Light-weight (only major dependency is [stdweb](https://github.com/koute/stdweb))

## What Panes it NOT
* A complete GUI library
* A Virtual DOM implementation

## Contribution
